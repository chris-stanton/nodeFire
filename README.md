# nodeFire with Mongo Authorization
AngularFire with token authentication on Node backend server. This branch uses the mongoose node module with a mongo database to show an authorization example.

## Get Started with nodeFire
1. Run these commands to add the project locally:
  ```shell
  $ git clone https://github.com/LukeSchlangen/nodeFire
  $ cd nodeFire
  $ git checkout mongo-authorization
  $ npm install
  ```

2. Create a free Firebase account at https://firebase.google.com

3. Create a project from your Firebase account console

4. Add a connection to firebase on your front end
  1. Click the “Add Firebase to your web app” icon
  2. Copy the contents WITHOUT SCRIPT TAGS or the CDN from the resulting popup into `public/scripts/config.js`. It should look like this:

    ```javascript
      // Initialize Firebase
      var config = {
        apiKey: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        authDomain: "XXXXXXXXXXXX.firebaseapp.com",
        databaseURL: "https://XXXXXXXXXXXX.firebaseio.com",
        storageBucket: "XXXXXXXXXXXX.appspot.com",
        messagingSenderId: "XXXXXXXXXX"
      };
      firebase.initializeApp(config);
    ```

5. Add a firebase service account to you node project
  1. Navigate to the [Service Accounts](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) tab in your project's settings page.
  2. Select your Firebase project.
  3. Copy your `databaseURL` from the `Admin SDK configuration snippet`. The line you need will look like this: `databaseURL: "https://XXXXXXXXX.firebaseio.com"`.
  4. Navigate to the `server/modules/decoder.js` file in the node project and replace the databaseURL. Only replace that line. It is inside of the `admin.initializeApp`:

    ```javascript
    admin.initializeApp({
      credential: admin.credential.cert("./server/firebase-service-account.json"),
      databaseURL: "https://XXXXXXXXX.firebaseio.com" // replace this line with your URL
    });
    ```
  5. Return to firebase [Service Accounts](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk). Navigate to your project again if you have left it.
  6. Click the Generate New Private Key button at the bottom of the Firebase Admin SDK section of the Service Accounts tab.
  7. Rename the new JSON file to `firebase-service-account.json` and save it in the `server` folder of your application.

6. Return to Firebase console. Configure Google as an authentication provider for your Firebase project.
  1. In the Firebase console for your project (you may already be there from the previous step), click "Authentication" in left panel
  2. Click "Set Up Sign-In Method" button
  3. Select "Google"
  4. Click the "edit" icon
  5. Toggle Google to `on`

7. Connect the application to your database
  1. Create a new mongo database or select one you already use. In `server/modules/database-config.js`, change the connection string, currently `var connectionString = 'postgres://localhost:5432/sigma';`, to match the location of your database.
  2. Copy the queries from the `database.js` file and run them in robomongo or the mongo terminal to create the necessary collections for this project. On the `db.users.insert`, be sure to add your own name and give yourself a clearance_level from 1 to 5. This will determine what data you can see:

    ```javascript
    db.users.insert(
       [
        { email: 'lukeschlangen@gmail.com', clearanceLevel: 5 },
        { email: 'youremail@gmail.com', clearanceLevel: 4 }, // Your Google Email added here
        { email: 'yourotheremail@gmail.com', clearanceLevel: 2 }, // Your Other Google Email added here
        { email: 'luke@primeacademy.io', clearanceLevel: 3 }
       ]
    );
    ```
  Because you have set up google OAuth, you will need to log in with a google account (an email with `@gmail.com` will work great). If you have a second google account, that will make it easy to see the differences for people with differing clearance levels.

8. Run `npm start` to run your application on `localhost:5000`

## Deploying
This is incredibly tedious the first time, but will automatically deploy your application with every future change. In order to deploy this project publicly, you will likely need to add your service account properties as environment variables. Here is how to do that with Heroku:

1. Convert `firebase-service-account` to `.env` variables
  1. Add `dotenv` to you project through `npm install --save dotenv`.
  2. Add a `.env` file to the root folder of your project. Copy this text into that file (note that there are no commas):

      ```
      FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TYPE="XXXXXXXXX"
      FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT_ID="XXXXXXXXX"
      FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY_ID="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
      FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nA Whole lot of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
      FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_EMAIL="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@XXXXXXXXX.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
      FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_ID="##################"
      FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_AUTH_URI="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
      FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_URI="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token"
      FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_AUTH_PROVIDER_X509_CERT_URL="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
      FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL="https://www.googleapis.com/XXXXXXXXXXX.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
      ```

      Replace every value from the right hand side of the equal sign inside of quotes in the `.env` file with the corresponding secret key from your `firebase-service-account.json` file:

      ```
      {
        "type": "XXXXXXXXX",
        "project_id": "XXXXXXXXX",
        "private_key_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nA Whole lot of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        "client_email": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@XXXXXXXXX.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
        "client_id": "##################",
        "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
        "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/XXXXXXXXXXX.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
      }
      ```

  3. Navigate to `server/modules/decoder.js`. Replace the reference to your `firebase-service-account.json` with an object that refers to all of your `.env` variables.

    ```javascript
    admin.initializeApp({
      credential: admin.credential.cert("./server/firebase-service-account.json"),
      databaseURL: "https://my-firebase-app.firebaseio.com" // you replaced this line earlier
    });
    ```

    Now becomes

    ```javascript
    admin.initializeApp({
      credential: admin.credential.cert({
        "type": process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TYPE,
        "project_id": process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT_ID,
        "private_key_id": process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY_ID,
        "private_key": process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY,
        "client_email": process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_EMAIL,
        "client_id": process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_ID,
        "auth_uri": process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_AUTH_URI,
        "token_uri": process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_URI,
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_AUTH_PROVIDER_X509_CERT_URL,
        "client_x509_cert_url": process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL
      }),
      databaseURL: "https://my-firebase-app.firebaseio.com"
    });
    ```
    4. In the `server/app.js` file, add `require('dotenv').config();` near the top of the file (as the first line is ideal)


2. Deploy to Heroku
  1. Create an [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account.
  2. Create a new Heroku Application.
  3. Under the `Settings` tab, in the `Config Variables` section, select `Reveal Config Vars`. Here you will need to add every configuration variable to the list (everything on the left side of the equals sign in your `.env` file is the key, everything on the right side is the value)
  4. Under the `Deploy` tab, in the `Deployment Method` section, select `Github`. Connect to the Github repository with your application.
  5. In the `Manual Deploy` section, click `Deploy Branch` to deploy for the first time.

3. Update firebase to allow another domain
  1. Return to the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) and select your current project.
  2. If the link from the step above doesn't navigate you there automatically, navigate to authentication in the left hand navigation and select `SIGN-IN MMETHOD`
  3. Scroll down to the `OAuth redirect domains` section and click the `ADD DOMAIN` button
  4. Add the new domain that your site is being hosted on, likely something like `https://rushing-waterfall.herokuapp.com/`

Super Secret Secrets - nodeFire Firebase and Mongo Auth:

Start with the mongo-authorization of the nodeFire repository. Since this application is doing authentication and requires connection to a database, the setup time might take a while. When the app is running, you should be able to return a list of secrets from the application after you log in.

Base Mode - Authenticated Post:
1.
- [ ] Allow an authenticated user to create a new secret.

If the user is logged in, they will see a form that allows them to add a new secret. The server should confirm (with the id token) that the user is authenticated, and then allow the secret to be added to the database.


Hard Mode - Authorized Post:

1.
- [ ] The new secrets a user creates should only have a secrecy level at or below the clearance level of the current user. This will need to be done with an authenticated post that sends a token. Any logic to determine the clearance level of the user should be done on the backend (because if it is done on the front end, it is not actually secure. Examples:

If Huck has a clearance level of 5, he can create new secret with a secrecy level of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
If Kris has a clearance level of 3, he can create new secret with a secrecy level of 1, 2, or 3.
If Luke has a clearance level of 3, he can create new secret with a secrecy level of 1, 2, or 3.

Pro Mode:
1.
 - [X] Your site needs another view. Create a second route and view on the front end that is available only to users who are authenticated. Examples:

If a user logs in, they will see a link to a users view. Ideally, this route will be /#/users
If a user is not logged in and attempts to navigate to /#/admin, they should be redirected to the login page

Ultra-Pro Mode:
Now that you have a second view, your http requests should be moved into factories. Ideally, your factories will look like:

Users Factory - Where your get request for users is made
Secrets Factory - Where your get and post requests for the secrets are made.
Auth Factory - Where your currentUser/firebaseUser object or idToken is stored <- build this one last and only if you have time, definitely commit before you do it
